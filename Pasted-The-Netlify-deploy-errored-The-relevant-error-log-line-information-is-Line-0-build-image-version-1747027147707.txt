Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failed with the error message:
```
npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/package.json'
```

This error indicates that the build process could not find the `package.json` file in the project directory.

### Solution
1. **Verify `package.json` exists**: Ensure that the `package.json` file is present in your project directory.
2. If the `package.json` file exists, make sure it is committed to the repository.
3. Check if the file path is correct in the build configuration or scripts that require `package.json`.
